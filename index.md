### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 Part 1 was one of my favorite labs because I was able to better my 
    understanding of Cin and Cout printing. I also really enjoyed the user 
    interaction with the fill-in-the-blank Madlibs code. I had a lot of fun 
    running the code.

* Lab 8
    Lab 8 Part 2 was another favorite lab of mine because I learned how to
    use for-loops to print characters in a way that formed a pattern as the 
    output. I thought the visual of the pattern was very cool. This lab also
    taught me how to create a for-loop inside of another for-loop.

* Lab 11
    Lab 11 Part 2 was also a favorite lab of mine because it taught me how to 
    utilize constructors and how to write definitions. Creating the Hi-Lo
    game was a very fun activity and easy to play. I always liked the labs 
    that provided an easy and friendly user interaction.
